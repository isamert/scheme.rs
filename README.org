* scheme.rs
/scheme.rs/ is a simple Scheme interpreter that implements considerably large
subset of R5RS with some extensions from R7RS. No dependencies to any other
Rust packages.

** Motivation
I was studying about compilers and interpreters. On the other hand I was
trying to learn Rust. So I combined those two and this project has emerged.
There are thousands of fast, mature and feature-rich Scheme interpreters that
you can use. This project is not intended to be usable in production although
I use it for my personal scripts and one can embed /scheme.rs/ into ones
project to provide scripting facilities.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; FizzBuzz
(define (fizzbuzz x y)
  (println
    (cond ((= (modulo x 15) 0 ) "FizzBuzz")
          ((= (modulo x 3) 0 ) "Fizz")
          ((= (modulo x 5) 0 ) "Buzz")
          (else x)))

    (if (< x y) (fizzbuzz (+ x 1) y)))

(fizzbuzz 1 100)

;; Read a line from file and print it
(call-with-input-file "file.txt"
  (λ (file)
    (println (read-line file))))

;; Tail recursive fibanocci
(define (fib n)
  (define (fib-helper a b n)
    (if (= n 0) a
        (fib-helper b (+ a b) (- n 1))))

  (fib-helper 0 1 n))

(display (fib 60)) ; prints 1548008755920
#+END_SRC

** Usage
Run it using cargo:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd scheme.rs
cargo run
#+END_SRC

This will fire up REPL. You can also run files directly:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo run filename.scm
#+END_SRC

** Notes about implementation
*** Extras
- Brackets can be used instead of parenthesis.

*** What is not included?
- Mutable lists
- Vectors (Lists are implemented in terms of vectors)
- Hygienic macros
- ~call-with-current-continuation~ and it's derivatives

*** Proper tail recursion
Tail calls are optimized but this implementation does not reflect the
standard fully. Because there are no macros, functions like ~and~, ~or~,
~cond~, ~let~ etc. are implemented as separate procedures. So a procedure with
~and~ in it's tail call may blow up the stack. Regardless of macro
implementation, I may fix this in the future simply by expanding required
functions before evaluation.

- [ ] Mutable lists

- [ ] Add useful SFRI's like:
  - [ ] SRFI-9 (Record types)
  - [ ] SRFI-6 (String ports)
  - [ ] SRFI-1 (List library, some of the functions are already available)
  - [ ] SRFI-13 (String library)

- Adding a basic VM with garbage collector may be a long term goal (which will
  allow implementation of cal/cc).

Fair amount of these functions are implemented in Rust.
